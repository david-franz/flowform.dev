# @flowtomic/flowform-react

React bindings for the FlowForm core library. This package will expose hooks and components for rendering FlowForm definitions inside React applications, including Flowtomicâ€™s node editors, dialogs, and standalone builders.

## Development

```bash
cd flowform/packages/react
npm install
npm run build
```

During early development the package re-exports the primitives from `@flowtomic/flowform` and provides a placeholder provider/hook pair.
